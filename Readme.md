This code was done during an undergraduated research "Comparing different methods of position
reconstruction considering 1D readout of GEM detectors"

The code which uses an analytical electron cloud is "run.py". 
The code which uses a discrete electron cloud is "run2.py". 

If you prefer you can use the Jupyter Notebook version, Position-Charge-Reconstruction.ipynb, which shows the documentation of the project.
