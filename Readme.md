This code was done during the undergraduated research project "Comparing different methods of position
reconstruction considering 1D readout of GEM detectors"

The code which uses an analytical electron cloud is "run.py". 
The code which uses a discrete electron cloud is "run2.py". 

The Jupyter Notebook version, Position-Charge-Reconstruction.ipynb, shows the documentation of the project.
